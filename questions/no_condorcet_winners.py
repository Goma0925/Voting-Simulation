"""
    This script is to study and answer the questions:
        â€¢ When the Condorcet winner does not exist, do Borda, plurality, and Copeland select the
        same alternative? How often do they coincide with each other?

        A: They do ocasionally produce the same results, but the probability is low.
            And as the number of voters/candidates increases, it gets even lower.
