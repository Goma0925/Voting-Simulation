    This script is to study and answer the questions:
        â€¢ How often does Plurality choose the Condorcet winner?
         A: Plurality rule does NOT always choose a condorcet winner, but it does most of the times.
            As the number of voters increases, the likelihood of choosing the condorcet winner decreases.
